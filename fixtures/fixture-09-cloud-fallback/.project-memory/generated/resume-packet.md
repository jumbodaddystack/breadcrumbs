# Resume Packet

## Project
**demo-service** — `.`  
branch `main` · commit `a1b2c3d` · clean

## Current Focus
Plain-file portability.

## Next Action
Verify a CLI-less agent can resume from the committed files.

## Active Decisions
- `dec_20260610_markdown-source-of-truth` — A read-only cloud agent can read plain files without the CLI.

## Failed Attempts To Avoid
- `att_20260612_sqlite-store` — do not retry: do not use a binary store unless plain-file export is automatic and reviewed.

## Known Traps

## Open Questions / Blockers

## Likely Relevant Files
