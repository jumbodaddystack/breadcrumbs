# CLI Specification

The CLI binary is `crumb` (installed via `pipx`/`pip` as of Phase 7; from a
source checkout the equivalent is `python crumb.py <command>`, a shim over
`breadcrumbs.cli`). The command surface is stable from Phase 1: every command supports the
global flags below; capture/resume additionally support `--fast`. As later phases
land, subcommands are added without changing established flag semantics.

---

## Global flags

Every command accepts:

```text
--json            machine-readable JSON output
--plain           plain-text output (no decoration)
--verbose         verbose output
--project <path>  project root (default: cwd)
--fast            capture/resume only: git-only, no prompts or LLM narrative
```

Default output is human-readable Markdown / plain text.

## Command table

| Command | Reads | Writes | Purpose | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `init` | project root | `.project-memory/`, `manifest.yml`, `.gitignore` edits | Install memory layout; record session + generated-projection policy in `manifest.yml`. | **1 (built)** |
| `validate` | all canonical files | validation output | Enforce schema and invariants (deterministic). | 2 |
| `remember decision` | git state, user input | decision record | Capture a durable choice. | 3 |
| `remember attempt` | git state, user input | attempt record | Capture a tried path and its outcome. | 3 |
| `capture session` | git state (log, status, diff --shortstat) | session record, handoff, current | Record session end; git-prefill body sections (Files Touched is a counts-only summary). `--fast` = git-only snapshot + one-line next action. | 3 |
| `schema [<type>]` | (none) | record contract | Print body sections / vocab / rules from source constants. `--template <type>` emits a `remember` skeleton. | **built** |
| `note question\|trap\|idea` | user input, git state | open-questions / known-traps / idea record | Write-surface for the three kinds with no `remember` type; refreshes the resume packet. | **built** |
| `resume` | current, handoff, records, git state | generated resume packet | Print a bounded resume packet (≤5k tokens) with computed staleness. `--fast` = git snapshot + focus + next action + staleness (print-only). | **4 (built)** |
| `guard "<action>"` | decisions, attempts, traps, questions, handoff | optional session note | Warn before a repeated mistake (deterministic ranking). | 5 |
| `audit` | all memory + adapters | health report | Find stale / unsafe / bloated memory (incl. secret + instruction-like heuristics). Heuristic — does NOT gate `validate`. | **6 (built)** |
| `scan-secrets` | committed memory | secret report | Scan committed memory for secret-like strings; non-zero on a hit. Run before committing memory. | **6 (built)** |
| `doctor` | adapters, `.mcp.json`, hooks, packet | integration-health report | Is memory wired up? Exit 1 if a store exists but no integration is active. | **built** |
| `mcp serve\|register` | `.mcp.json` | running server / registration | Run the MCP server, or merge its `.mcp.json` entry. | **built** |
| `hook session\|guard\|capture` | hook stdin payload | hook JSON on stdout | Claude Code hook translators (`init --with-hooks` installs them). | **built** |

### Integration flags on `init`

```text
init --with-adapter[=CLAUDE.md,…] / --no-adapter   # signpost block in detected guidance files
init --with-mcp / --no-mcp                          # merge .mcp.json entry
init --with-hooks[=session,guard,capture] / --no-hooks
init --print-integrations                           # dry run
init --remove-integrations                          # reverse everything
```

On a TTY with none specified, `init` asks once per integration; non-interactive +
unspecified writes nothing (plus a one-line nudge). Every edit is fenced and
reversible.

### Later commands (post-MVP)

```text
mark-status <id> <status>
supersede <old-id> <new-id>
build-index
dashboard | recent | where-was-i
```

## `init` (built)

```bash
crumb init
crumb init --session-tracking <full|distillate>
crumb init --no-commit-generated
crumb init --project <path>
crumb init --force
```

Behavior:

- Refuses to clobber an existing `.project-memory/` unless `--force`.
- Copies the bundled `breadcrumbs/templates/project-memory/` tree (shipped as
  package data, resolved package-relative) into the target's `.project-memory/`.
- Auto-derives `project` (root dir name), `created_at` (ISO-8601 w/ tz), and sets
  `schema_version: 1`.
- **Session-tracking policy:** `--session-tracking <full|distillate>`, else prompt;
  non-interactive default is `full`. Recorded in `manifest.yml`.
- **Generated-projection policy:** default `commit_generated_projections: true`;
  `--no-commit-generated` flips it. Recorded in `manifest.yml`.
- Writes a managed `.gitignore` block matching the policies. `index/**` is always
  ignored (except `index/README.md`); `private/**` is always ignored;
  `--no-commit-generated` ignores `generated/*.md` (keeping the README);
  `distillate` ignores `sessions/`.
- **Non-git fallback:** detects whether the project is a git repo; if not, prints a
  notice that git-derived record fields will use the sentinels documented in
  [`record-schema.md`](record-schema.md) §7 (`branch: (no-git)`,
  `commit: (no-git)`, `dirty_files: []`).
- `--json` emits a machine summary of what was created and the chosen policies.

---

## `resume` (built)

```bash
crumb resume                  # full bounded packet; writes generated/resume-packet.md
crumb resume --fast           # reduced reorientation view (print-only)
crumb resume --json           # structured packet (sections + warnings + source header)
crumb resume --stale-days N   # aged-unresolved threshold in days (default: 21)
```

Behavior:

- Assembles the §12 packet from `current.md`, `handoff.md`, active `decisions/`,
  active `attempts/`, `known-traps.md`, `open-questions.md`, and live git state.
- **Bounding:** per-section caps, then a hard **5,000-token** ceiling (chars/4
  heuristic). Current/handoff/active-decisions outrank old session observations;
  lower-priority sections are trimmed first and an omission note is shown. Raw
  transcripts are never included.
- **Computed staleness** (not just authored): handoff **age + commit-distance**,
  **aged-unresolved** questions/decisions (> `--stale-days`), **branch mismatch**
  (incl. detached HEAD), and **expired**/**low-confidence** records.
- **Source header:** every packet carries `source_commit` / `inputs_hash` /
  `generated_at` (carrying the `GENERATED PROJECTION` marker so `validate` accepts
  it and `audit` can later detect drift).
- Writes `generated/resume-packet.md` (the committed cloud-fallback artifact under
  the default policy). `--fast` is **print-only** and never overwrites it.
- Exit codes: `0` on success, `2` when no `.project-memory/` store is present.

---

## `audit` (built)

```bash
crumb audit                  # human health report
crumb audit --json           # structured findings (check/severity/path/message)
crumb audit --plain          # one line per finding
crumb audit --stale-days N   # aged-unresolved threshold (default: 21)
```

`audit` is the **heuristic** safety net that `validate`'s determinism intentionally
excludes (see the determinism note). It never gates `validate`; it advises. Findings
carry a severity:

- **fail** — blocks (non-zero exit). The *only* fail-severity check is a **secret
  leak**: a token-like string in committed memory (see `scan-secrets`). This must be
  resolved before any "commit memory" workflow.
- **warn** — flag for human review; never changes the exit code. Covers: stale
  handoff (age + commit-distance), branch mismatch (incl. detached HEAD),
  aged-unresolved questions/decisions, expired + low-confidence records,
  **instruction-like text** (override phrasing such as "ignore the tests" — flagged,
  never executed: matched memory is data, not command), **generated-packet drift**
  (a committed projection whose stamped `inputs_hash` no longer matches the canonical
  inputs → regenerate), bloat (adapter files duplicating memory; over-budget packet),
  and the validate-failing health conditions re-surfaced for one health view (missing
  evidence, invalid status, private-path violation, id/frontmatter disagreement).
- **info** — context note (e.g. `sessions/` growth → consider a rollup).

Exit codes: `1` when any **fail** finding is present (a secret), else `0`; `2` when no
`.project-memory/` store is present.

---

## `scan-secrets` (built)

```bash
crumb scan-secrets           # human report; non-zero on any hit
crumb scan-secrets --json    # {ok, count, hits:[{pattern, path, line}]}
```

The secret sub-check of `audit`, exposed standalone so it can run as a pre-commit /
pre-push gate before memory is committed (§2.6, §15). Scans committed memory only —
`private/`, `index/`, and `generated/` are skipped. Reports the matched pattern
**name** and location, never the secret value. Coverage is deliberately conservative
(AWS/GitHub/Slack/Google/OpenAI-style keys, JWTs, PEM private-key headers, bearer
tokens, `secret/token/password=`-style assignments, and mixed-class high-entropy
blobs); see the Phase 6 doc for the covered-set / known-gaps record. Exit codes: `1`
on any hit, `0` when clean, `2` when no store is present.

---

## `--fast` semantics

For `capture` and `resume` (Phases 3–4): skip all prompts and any LLM narrative and
operate from git state only. `capture --fast` writes a git-only snapshot plus a
one-line next action (~15-second path for a tired human). `resume --fast` prints the
git snapshot, current focus, next action, and computed staleness warnings only —
skipping the fuller record summaries.

---

## Determinism note

`validate` is fully deterministic. Heuristics (secret scan, instruction-like text
detection) live in `audit`, never in `validate`. See
[`security.md`](security.md).
